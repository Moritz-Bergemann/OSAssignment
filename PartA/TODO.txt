- Handle what happends when LiftR finishes reading file but lift processes are still looking for new requests
    - Could handle by making lift processes wait a certain amount of time and then cancelling if no new requests come in?
    - Could make request process send some kind of signal informing lifts that it is complete
SOLVED: I did both, still need to implmement the wait part
